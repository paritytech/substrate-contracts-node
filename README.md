# substrate-contracts-node

This repository contains Substrate's [`node-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/node-template)
configured to include Substrate's [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts)
‒ a smart contract module.

This repository is tracking Substrate's `master`.
The last time it was synchronized with Substrate was up to
[6b85535](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/6b8553511112afd5ae7e8e6877dc2f467850f155).

_This repository contains a couple of modifications that make it unsuitable
for a production deployment, but a great fit for development and testing:_

* The unstable features of the [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts)
  are enabled by default (see the [`runtime/Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/blob/main/runtime/Cargo.toml)).
* The consensus algorithm has been switched to `manual-seal` in
  [#42](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/pull/42).
  Hereby blocks are authored immediately at every transaction, so there
  is none of the typical six seconds block time associated with `grandpa` or `aura`.
* _If no CLI arguments are passed the node is started in development mode
  by default._
* A custom logging filter is applied by default that hides block production noise
  and prints the contracts debug buffer to the console.
* _With each start of the node process the chain starts from genesis ‒ so no
  chain state is retained, all contracts will be lost! If you want to retain
  chain state you have to supply a `--base-path`._
* For `pallet_contracts::Config` we increased the allowed contract sizes. This
  avoids running into `CodeTooLarge` when uploading contracts during development.
  See the comment in [`runtime/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/blob/main/runtime/src/lib.rs)
  for more details.

If you are looking for a node suitable for production see these configurations:

* [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/node-template)
* [Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template)
* [Contracts Parachain Configuration for Rococo](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachains/runtimes/contracts/contracts-rococo)

## Installation

### Download Binary

The easiest way is to download a binary release from [our releases page](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases)
and just execute `./substrate-contracts-node`.

### Build Locally

Follow the [official installation steps](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/installation/)
to set up all Substrate prerequisites.

Afterwards you can install this node via

```bash
cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git --force --locked
```

The `--locked` flag makes the installation use the same versions
as the `Cargo.lock` in those repositories ‒ ensuring that the last
known-to-work version of the dependencies are used.

The latest confirmed working Substrate commit which will then be used is
[74a6370](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/74a6370e805ebaf88b7939e496818531f762cadf).

## Usage

To run a local dev node execute

```bash
substrate-contracts-node
```

A new chain in temporary directory will be created each time the command is executed. This is the
default for this node. If you want to persist chain state across runs you need to
specify a directory with `--base-path`.

### Show only Errors and Contract Debug Output

To have only errors and contract debug output show up on the console you can
supply `-lerror,runtime::contracts=debug` when starting the node.

Important: Debug output is only printed for RPC calls or off-chain tests ‒ not for transactions!

See our FAQ for more details:
[How do I print something to the console from the runtime?](https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/faq/#how-do-i-print-something-to-the-console-from-the-runtime).

## Connect with frontend

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect to it with frontends like [Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/#/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944) or [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) and interact with your chain.

## How to synchronize with Substrate

- [ ] Check Substrate's [`node-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/commits/master/bin/node-template)
      for new commits since the last time someone synchronized this
			repository with Substrate. The commit hash of the last sync is
			mentioned in this readme.
- [ ] Apply each commit that happened in this `node-template` folder
      since the last sync.
- [ ] Check commits for [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts)
      since the last time someone synchronized this repository with Substrate
      in order to not miss any important changes.
- [ ] Execute `cargo update -p pallet-contracts` for this repository. The
      specific crate which is mentioned here is actually not important: since
      Substrate uses git references for its Substrate dependencies it means
      that once one package is updated all are.
- [ ] Increment the minor version number in `node/Cargo.toml` and `runtime/Cargo.toml`.
- [ ] Execute `cargo run --release -- --tmp`. If successful, it should produce blocks
      and a new, up to date, `Cargo.lock` will be created.
- [ ] Update this readme with the hash of the Substrate `master` commit
      with which you synchronized. The hash appears two times in this
			readme.
- [ ] Create a PR with the changes, have it reviewed and merged.
- [ ] Replace `XX` in this command with your incremeted version number and execute it:
      `git checkout main && git pull && git tag v0.XX.0 && git push origin v0.XX.0`.
			This will push a new tag with the version number to this repository.
- [ ] We have set this repository up in a way that tags à la `vX.X.X` trigger
      a CI run that creates a GitHub draft release. You can observe CI runs on
      [GitLab](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/mirrors/substrate-contracts-node/-/pipelines).
      This draft release will contain a binary for Linux and Mac and appear
      under [Releases](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases).
      Add a description in the style of "Synchronized with Substrate commit
      [c0ee2a](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/c0ee2adaa54b22ee0df5d1592cd0430961afd95c)."
      and publish it.
